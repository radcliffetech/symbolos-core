# 🌌 About Symbolos

**Symbolos** is a symbolic simulation engine for modeling transformation, judgment, and emergent meaning in structured systems. At its core, it is an **engine of symbolic causality** — one that allows for the execution, mutation, and narration of symbolic objects over time.

This core module, **Symbolos Core**, provides the minimal, embeddable substrate for such simulation. It focuses on:

- ✅ Defining symbolic objects, functors, pipelines, and agents
- ✅ Executing transformations tick-by-tick within symbolic worlds
- ✅ Forking worlds and tracking provenance of each decision
- ✅ Building narratable and explainable simulations

## 🔁 Why Symbolos?

Symbolos enables a new paradigm: **worlds that understand themselves**. Every transformation, every judgment, and every fork is **traceable** and **replayable**. This allows for:

- 📚 Narrative simulations with symbolic memory and history
- 🧠 Agent-based learning or judgment systems
- 🧪 Procedural metaphysics and counterfactual modeling
- 🧩 Flexible, forkable symbolic pipelines for experimentation

## 🧠 Design Principles

1. **Symbol over number**: Symbolos operates on structured symbolic entities, not numerical vectors.
2. **Causality over mutation**: All changes occur through functors and are tracked step-by-step.
3. **Forkability over finality**: At any point, a world can diverge — and both versions can persist and evolve independently.
4. **Provenance over output**: Knowing _why_ something changed is as important as what changed.

## 🚀 Example Applications

- Simulate ethical decision-making with full narrative history
- Create cognitive models of agents learning from structured experience
- Generate evolving mythologies, ideologies, or symbolic ecosystems
- Run counterfactual policy simulations with symbolic trace
