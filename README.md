# 🧠 Symbolos Core

**Symbolos Core** is a meta-systems substrate, a symbolic simulation and transformation engine. It enables programmable worlds, causal pipelines, and agent-based symbolic reasoning using structured Functors and Pipelines.

This core module provides the universal symbolic substrate for higher-level applications in narrative AI, procedural metaphysics, planning, and beyond.

## ❓ Why Symbolos Core?

Symbolos Core is designed for researchers, system architects, and AI builders who want a programmable foundation for simulating and transforming symbolic systems. It enables composable, introspectable worlds with structured change over time.

Common use cases include:

- Simulation of agents and symbolic environments
- Symbolic planning, memory, and world forking
- Procedural metaphysics and world generation
- Building blocks for language, art, and cognition tools
