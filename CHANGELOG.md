---

## [0.1.1] — 2025-06-09

🧼 Structural Improvements

- Moved all CLI code to top-level `/cli` for modularity
- Relocated functors and pipelines to `/examples` to keep `core/` minimal
- Updated `.npmignore` to exclude tests, examples, CLI, and docs from NPM package

🧠 Functional Enhancements

- Added `createSymbolicObject()` factory to standardize object creation (IDs, timestamps, types)
- Refactored `storeWorldArchive`, `storeWorldFrame`, and `PipelineRun` to use the factory
- Improved ID formatting with slugified type names (e.g. `world-frame-...`)

🧪 Test Coverage

- Added tests for functors (`InitializeConwayCells`, `StepConwayCells`, `LinkSymbols`)
- Added pipeline execution test for `conwayGame`
- Added tests for `storeWorldArchive()` and `storeWorldFrame()`

🧾 Licensing & Publishing

- Clarified NPM packaging boundaries
- All tests, examples, and development files excluded from final package
- Repository and author metadata verified

🔧 Streaming & I/O Improvements

- Centralized archive path resolution logic via `resolveArchivePath()`
- `storeWorldArchive` and `storeWorldFrame` now support dynamic compression with `config.compress`
- Output files can be routed via `config.outputRoot` and `archiveDirName`
- Added optional frontend copy for final world archives

🧪 Enhanced Testing

- Mocked zlib and stream pipelines to support compressed and uncompressed cases
- Added tests for:
  - compression toggle
  - empty artifact archives
  - custom output directory names
- Validated pipeline stream structure to avoid `ENOENT` and stream signature errors

🧼 Misc

- Updated Readable and Gzip mocks to use `PassThrough` streams for full compatibility
- Cleaned up legacy pipeline writing logic

## [0.1.2] — 2025-06-09

📁 Structural & Distribution

- Moved all core code into `src/` directory for clarity and publishability
- Updated `package.json` to point to `src/index.ts` for `main` and `types`
- Updated `tsconfig.json` includes to match new `src/` layout
- Updated `README.md` with accurate file structure

📦 NPM Interface

- Exported `conwayGame` and functors directly via top-level `index.ts`
- Simplified import paths for consumers of the package

🧪 Tests

- Preserved all test coverage under `src/`, with working CLI and archive persistence
- Tests now run against new layout with all mocks and pipeline behaviors intact

## [0.1.1] — 2025-06-09

- Refactor repo into src/
- Tidy and refresh
